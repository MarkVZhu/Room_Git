# WKU CPS4951 Group#15 Project: ROOM
## Introduction  
In the WKU CPS4951 course, our group builds this game: ROOM. Room is a story-oriented and suspenseful game, and we want to warn people away from drugs 
with this game. In ROOM, we made a lot of metaphors about drugs. This git repository contains all the assets and scripts of our project.
The following picture is the logo of ROOM.

## Design
This game uses the puzzle in levels to tell the story of a person on drugs. In his last moments of life, he tried saving himself and discovering the truth. The player learns the reality behind all the mysteries around him by taking on the role and searching for answers in different rooms. In ROOM, players can experience the discomfort and pain of a man on drugs, and the designs of scenes, interactions, and stories in the game all do tell the player how dangerous drugs are.  


## Program
Room has multiple camera perspectives, and there are three different input managers and character controllers in the game. Therefore, players can use different input modes at different levels.  In addition, the dialogue system realizes the dialogue and interaction between Character and NPC. Moreover, A instance under a singleton pattern stores information about the character and controls its state and the gameâ€™s results.
