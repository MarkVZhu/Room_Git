Where I am now. Ugh, it is so itchy. This space seems full of ants. 
B
You are in your recurring dream. To stop suffering from the itch, you need to expel the ants by pushing the Insect repellent box.
B
You can enter the next layer of your dream through the top-right  or bottom-left corner.
B
But when you are entering, you will receive the damage according to how many ants blocks are left. 
B
As you expel all ants here, you will find something. 
A
What is it? And how can you talk in my dream?
B
I cannot tell you more, just remember, consider carefully before you take action, and do the right thing. Good luck!
