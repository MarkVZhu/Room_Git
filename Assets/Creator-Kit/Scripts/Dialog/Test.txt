Hello, sir. I hope you know where I can find some kind of medicine to relieve my serious headache. 
A
Er... I ... I know.
B
So...? (He's so weird, dressing like a priest. Who is him?)
A
I was just like you, and I hope you will know who I am. 
A
Well, there is a drug in the leftmost room you can use. 
B
Ok, thank you! (Is it an illusion? Can he hear my thoughts?)
A
Don't worry. Anyway, you should know that maybe patience is the best way to get rid of it. 
B
Mhm...Ok. (What?)
A
Never mind, go and do the right thing.
